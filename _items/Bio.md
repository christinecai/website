I am Christine Cai(-square distributed), a third-year <font color="orange">Ph.D. Student in Economics</font> at <font color="orange">Princeton University</font>.
	
My research interests lie in <font color="orange">applied microeconomics</font> and span <font color="orange">labor, education, urban, public, and health economics</font>. I am particularly interested in issues related to segregation, migrations, educational inequalities, and social mobility.
	
Before the start of my Ph.D. program, I worked as a full-time <font color="orange">research assistant</font> for <a href="http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/rebecca.dizon-ross/">Professor Rebecca Dizon-Ross</a> at the University of <font color="orange">Chicago Booth</font> School of Business.
	
My <font color="orange">CV</font> can be viewed/downloaded <a href="/assets/pdf/Christine_Cai_CV.pdf">here</a>.
	
I can be reached at <font color="orange">christine.cai@princeton.edu</font>. Otherwise, if you happen to visit Princeton, I can be found in office 264 located in the Industrial Relations Section (on the second floor of the Department of Economics building). These days though, I am mostly wandering around Zoomland...!
