I am Christine Cai(-square distributed), a third-year <font color="IndianRed">Ph.D. Student in Economics</font> at <font color="IndianRed">Princeton University</font>.
	
My research interests lie in <font color="IndianRed">applied microeconomics</font> and span <font color="IndianRed">labor, education, urban, public, and health economics</font>. I am particularly interested in issues related to segregation, migrations, educational inequalities, and social mobility.
	
Before the start of my Ph.D. program, I worked as a full-time <font color="IndianRed">research assistant</font> for <a href="http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/rebecca.dizon-ross/">Professor Rebecca Dizon-Ross</a> at the University of <font color="IndianRed">Chicago Booth</font> School of Business.
	
My <font color="IndianRed">CV</font> can be viewed/downloaded <a href="/assets/pdf/Christine_Cai_CV.pdf">here</a>.
	
Feel free to reach out to me at <font color="IndianRed">christine.cai@princeton.edu</font>, or if you happen to visit Princeton, you can drop by office 264 in the Industrial Relations Section (especially if you want to hit a few ping pong balls!). These days though, I am mostly wandering around Zoomland...!
