I am Christine Cai(-square distributed), a third-year Ph.D. Student in Economics at Princeton University.

My research interests lie in applied microeconomics and span labor, education, urban, public, and health economics. I am particularly interested in issues related to segregation, migrations, educational inequalities, and social mobility.

Before the start of my Ph.D. program, I worked as a full-time research assistant for Professor Rebecca Dizon-Ross at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.

My rÃ©sumÃ© can be viewed/downloaded here.

I can be reached at christine.cai@princeton.edu. Otherwise, if you happen to visit Princeton, I can be found in office 264 located in the Industrial Relations Section (on the second floor of the Department of Economics building). These days though, I am mostly wandering around Zoomland...!

Finally, if you'd like to, you can follow me on Twitter ðŸ˜Š.
